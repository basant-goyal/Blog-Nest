Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- An [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) account for backend services.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh

    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**

    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your Appwrite backend:**
    - Log in to your Appwrite console and create a new project.
    - Create a new Web App and add its details (hostname, etc.).
    - In **Auth**, enable the Email/Password provider.
    - In **Databases**, create a new database.
    - Inside the database, create a collection for your posts with the required attributes (e.g., `title`, `content`, `featuredImage`, `status`, `userId`).
    - In **Storage**, create a new bucket for storing featured images.
    - Note down your **Project ID**, **API Endpoint URL**, **Database ID**, **Collection ID**, and **Bucket ID**.

4.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    - Add the following environment variables with your Appwrite project credentials:

    ```env
    VITE_APPWRITE_URL="YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT_URL"
    VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID"
    VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID="YOUR_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID"
    VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID="YOUR_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID"
